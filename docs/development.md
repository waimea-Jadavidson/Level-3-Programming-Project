- **Design ideas / notes** for features, UI, etc.
- **Key features** completed and working
- **Interesting bugs** and how you overcame them

Improved movement system with error checking to prevent out of map occurrence. The movement has been incorporated into the function ```playerMovement()```.
This keeps the coder safer as it's stored in the app instead of the view.

I have taken inspiration from James on how he has done his scenes, I found my current method to be very cluttered.
By using this I can make my code easier and clear to read and debug later on.

### Scene Improvements

I have improved on my scenes.kt file and fixed a bug where scenes were storing into one list and overwriting each other.
This was causing a bug where switching between two levels became impossible and you would get stuck.

### Map Error Prevention

By adding this pop up dialog it provides a reason for players not being able
to move in a certain direction due to map boundries
