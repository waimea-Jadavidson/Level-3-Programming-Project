- **Design ideas / notes** for features, UI, etc.
- **Key features** completed and working
- **Interesting bugs** and how you overcame them
- **Significant changes** to your design
- Etc.

Improved movement system with error checking to prevent out of map occurrence. The movement has been incorporated into the function ```playerMovement()```.
This keeps the coder safer as it's stored in the app instead of the view.

I have taken inspiration from James on how he has done his scenes, I found my current method to be very cluttered.
By using this I can make my code easier and clear to read and debug later on.
